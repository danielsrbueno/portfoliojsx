This passion led to a constant pursuit of improvement. Consequently, the decision was made to apply for the Systems Development course at Etec Jaragu√°, combining it with High School education. Fortunately, acceptance came with the honor of securing second place.",

Although focused on the frontend area at the moment, the goal is to become a full stack developer. Plans include applying for internship positions to gain professional experience, having no previous work in this field.",
