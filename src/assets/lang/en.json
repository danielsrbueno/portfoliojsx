I work on projects with ReactJS, NodeJS, among other technologies, and I wish to explore new languages, technologies, and frameworks. Although I am currently in the frontend area, I want to become a full stack developer. I plan to apply for internship positions to gain professional experience, as I have never worked in this field.",
